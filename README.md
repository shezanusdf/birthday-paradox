# Birthday Paradox

A Python project that simulates the classic probability problem known as the **Birthday Paradox**.  
This program estimates the likelihood that at least two people in a group share the same birthday.

---

## Overview

The Birthday Paradox demonstrates a counterintuitive result in probability theory:

- In a group of only 23 people,  
- The chance that two people share the same birthday is greater than 50%.

This project uses computational simulation to model that probability and compare it with the theoretical result.

## Features

- Random birthday generation  
- Simulation of groups of configurable size upto 100  
- Repeated trials for probability estimation
